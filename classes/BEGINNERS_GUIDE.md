## 🎨 What is Coding?

**Coding** is like giving instructions to a computer! Just like you follow recipes to bake cookies, computers follow code to do things.

### Think of it this way:
- 🍪 **Recipe**: "Mix flour and sugar, then bake for 10 minutes"
- 💻 **Code**: "Show a button, when clicked, play a sound"

When you write code, you're telling the computer exactly what to do, step by step!

### What can you build with code?
- 🎮 Games (like Roblox!)
- 🌐 Websites (like YouTube!)
- 📱 Apps (like your favorite games!)
- 🤖 Robots and cool gadgets!

## 🧰 Your GitHub Toolbox

GitHub is like a special backpack where you keep all your code projects! Let's learn the important tools:

### 1. 📦 **Repository (Repo)**
- This is your project folder!
- Think of it like a school binder where you keep all your homework for one subject
- **HendrixCode** is YOUR repository! 🎉

### 2. 📝 **Commits**
- A commit is like taking a snapshot of your work
- It's saving your progress in a game!
- Every time you make changes and want to save them, you make a commit
- **Example**: "Added new player character" or "Fixed the jump button"

### 3. 🔀 **Branches**
- Branches let you try new ideas without breaking your main project
- Like having a rough draft and a final copy
- The main branch is called `main` - that's your finished work
- You can make a new branch called `my-experiment` to try things out!

### 4. 🎯 **Pull Requests (PRs)**
- When you finish work on a branch, you can ask to add it to the main project
- It's like saying "Hey! I made something cool, can we add it?"
- Others can look at your changes and suggest improvements

### 5. 📋 **Issues**
- Issues are like a to-do list
- You can write down:
  - 🐛 Bugs you found ("The button doesn't work!")
  - 💡 New ideas ("Let's add a rainbow background!")
  - ❓ Questions ("How do I make music play?")

### 6. 📂 **Files and Folders**
- Your code lives in files (like README.md or game.py)
- Folders help organize everything (like the `classes/` folder you're reading this in!)

## 📱 Using GitHub on iPad

GitHub works great on your iPad! Here's how to use it:

### Getting Started:
1. **Open the GitHub app** on your iPad
2. **Sign in** with your account
3. **Find your repository** (HendrixCode)
4. You can see all your files and folders!

### What you can do on iPad:

#### 📖 Reading Files

- Learn from examples

#### ✏️ Editing Files
- Tap the pencil icon ✏️ to edit
- Make your changes
- Write a commit message (what you changed)
- Tap "Commit changes" to save!

#### 🆕 Creating New Files
- Tap the "+" button
- Choose "Create new file"
- Give it a name (like `my-game.py`)
- Start writing code!

#### 👀 Looking at Changes
- You can see what changed with green (added) and red (removed) colors
- Green lines are new code you added
- Red lines are old code you removed

#### 💬 Working with Issues
- Tap "Issues" to see your to-do list
- Create new issues for ideas
- Close issues when you finish them!

### 💡 Pro Tips for iPad:
- Use two fingers to scroll in code files

## 🗣️ Understanding Code Languages

Just like people speak different languages (English, Spanish, French), computers understand different **programming languages**!

### Popular Languages and What They Do:

#### 🐍 **Python**
- Great for beginners!
- Used for games, websites, and robots
- Easy to read and write
```python
print("Hello, Hendrix!")
name = "Hendrix"
print("Welcome, " + name)
```

#### 🌐 **JavaScript**
- Makes websites interactive!
- Used in Roblox too!
- Can make buttons click and animations move
```javascript
console.log("Hello, Hendrix!");
let score = 100;
alert("Your score is: " + score);
```

#### 🎮 **Lua**
- **This is what Roblox uses!** 🎉
- Perfect for making Roblox games
- Controls how your game works
```lua
print("Hello, Hendrix!")
local player = "Hendrix"
print("Welcome, " .. player)
```

#### 🎨 **HTML & CSS**
- HTML builds websites (the structure)
- CSS makes them pretty (the style)
```html
<h1>Welcome to Hendrix's Website!</h1>
<button>Click Me!</button>
```

### Which language should you learn first?
- **For Roblox games**: Start with **Lua**! 🎮
- **For websites**: Try **HTML/CSS** and **JavaScript**! 🌐
- **For general coding**: **Python** is awesome! 🐍

All languages have similar ideas, so once you learn one, others get easier!

## 🎭 Frontend vs Backend

Let's imagine you're running a restaurant! 🍕

### 🎨 **Frontend** (What customers see)
- This is what people SEE and CLICK
- The buttons, colors, pictures, and animations
- Like the dining room and menu in a restaurant

**Examples:**
- The buttons in a game
- The colors on a website
- How a character moves on screen
- What you click and touch

**Languages:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

### ⚙️ **Backend** (What happens behind the scenes)
- This is the BRAIN of your program
- It does the thinking and remembering
- Like the kitchen in a restaurant

**Examples:**
- Saving your high score
- Remembering your username
- Checking if you won the game
- Storing your inventory items

**Languages:** Python, JavaScript, Lua

### 🤝 They Work Together!
- Frontend: "Player clicked the jump button!"
- Backend: "Okay, make the character jump THIS high!"
- Frontend: "Got it, showing the jump animation!"

### For Your Roblox Game:
- **Frontend**: How your game looks, the characters, the world
- **Backend**: The game rules, scoring, what happens when you touch things
